//When you use the "" it is a quote, it writes whats in the Quote.
//Here we want to use the Veriable Kingposition
//Thet contains the Value d1 instead
//To do that you write it without the "".

//We start with declaring a variable named kingposition 

    //Place of the king
        string Kingposition = "d1"; //Declaring the variable, Type,Name (assigment operator = VALUE);
       //access the value 
        Console.WriteLine(Kingposition);

//Move the king

        //Reassignment 
    Kingposition = "d2";
        //access the value 
    Console.WriteLine(Kingposition); 
//Here we pass the value on the Variable to the function Writeline.
